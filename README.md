# Flutter Supabase Real-Time Student App

A simple yet powerful Flutter application demonstrating real-time CRUD (Create, Read) operations for a student database using Supabase as the backend. This project showcases how to listen to live database changes and reflect them instantly in the UI.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- You need to have the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed.
- A free account on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

### 1. Supabase Setup

Before running the app, you need to set up your Supabase project.

**A. Create a New Project**
1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2. Note your **Project URL** and **`anon` public key**. You'll need these later.

**B. Create the `Student` Table**
1. In your Supabase project, go to the **SQL Editor**.
2. Click **New query** and run the following SQL to create the `Student` table with the correct columns:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE "Student" (
     "id" bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
     "created_at" timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
     "name" text,
     "phone" text,
     "email" text,
     "roll" bigint,
     "address" text,
     CONSTRAINT "Student_pkey" PRIMARY KEY (id)
   );
   ```

**C. Enable Real-Time Replication (Crucial Step)**
1. In your Supabase project, go to **Database** in the left sidebar.
2. Select **Replication**.
3. Find your `public` schema and find the `Student` table.
4. Click the toggle switch under the **Source** column to enable replication. This allows the database to broadcast changes.

### 2. Project Configuration

Now, connect your Flutter app to your new Supabase project.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Open `lib/main.dart`**.

3.  **Update Supabase credentials**: Replace the placeholder URL and anon key with the ones from your Supabase project.
    ```dart
    // lib/main.dart

    await Supabase.initialize(
      url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',    // üëà Paste your Project URL here
      anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY', // üëà Paste your anon public key here
    );
    ```

### 3. Run the App

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

2.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    The app should now connect to your Supabase backend and work as expected.
